# Income Probability
 Predicting Income levels based on featured data

Using Random Forest methodology to predict the most imporant features that will determine income levels
Using data from UCI, I used Random Forest methodology to see which features will impact someone from having a salary greater than 50k or less than 50k

Image shown below is a train/test data without refined hyperparameters

Image below is a train/test data with refined parameters by finding optimal depth and n_estimators
Also refined the features list to look through education level
